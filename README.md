# Crimson Ember Steakhouse Website

This repository contains the source code for the Crimson Ember Steakhouse landing page. It is a responsive, single-page website template tailored for the hospitality industry. The design focuses on elegance and clarity, utilizing a rich color palette to highlight the premium dining experience.

## Project Overview

The website serves as a digital point of contact for the restaurant. It allows potential customers to explore the menu, check the availability of services (such as delivery or dine-in), read social proof from other diners, and easily find location and contact details.

## Key Features

### Hero Section
The landing page features a large, immersive background image with a clear value proposition. It includes a rating badge to establish trust immediately and call-to-action buttons that direct users to the menu or contact section.

### Categorized Menu Grid
The menu section is organized into distinct categories (Starters, Main Courses, Sides, Desserts) using a responsive grid layout. Each item displays the name, a price, and a brief description.

### Service Availability Status
A dedicated section informs customers about current service operations. It visually distinguishes between available and unavailable services (e.g., Dine-in vs. Delivery) using color-coded icons and text, which can be toggled via CSS classes.

### Responsive Design
The website is built to adapt to various screen sizes.
* **Desktop:** Displays a full horizontal navigation bar and multi-column layouts.
* **Mobile:** Utilizes a hamburger menu for navigation and stacks grid elements into a single column for better readability on small screens.

### Design System
* **Typography:** Uses 'Playfair Display' for elegant headings and 'Lato' for readable body text.
* **Color Palette:** Features Wine Red (Primary), Cream (Background), and Gold (Accents) to convey a classic, high-end restaurant feel.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the webpage.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling including Flexbox, CSS Grid, and CSS Variables for theme management.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the mobile navigation toggle logic and navbar scroll effects.
* **FontAwesome:** Provides the iconography used throughout the interface.
* **Google Fonts:** Source for the typography.

## File Structure

* **index.html:** The main document containing the structure of the Home, About, Menu, Services, and Contact sections.
* **style.css:** Contains all styling rules, media queries, and root variable definitions.
* **script.js:** Manages DOM interactions for the responsive menu and scroll-based styling changes.
